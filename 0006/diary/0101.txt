　　Online Games
　　As a product of modem computer and the Internet, online games have won great popularity among people, youngsters in particular. However, some people believe that young people who lack self-discipline can easily get indulged in these games and their health and academic performances are severely affected. This phenomenon can be found on TV reports from time to time, and many teachers and parents have expressed their concerns over this.
　　However, some others argue that online games are not always harmful. They can train the ability of youngsters to respond to things quickly. Moreover, they can stimulate their imagination and their interest in computer science. More importantly, it does bring people much pleasure and satisfaction, and release their pressure greatly.
　　From my point of view, online games are a wonderful entertainment if you play them in a reasonable way. When they interfere too much with your life, you'd better give them up at once. Yet if you have enough self-control over them, you can certainly obtain real pleasure and benefit a lot from them.
