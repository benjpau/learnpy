Of all the elements that promote the development of our society, perhaps the most far-reaching has been invention. It is difficult to the point of impossibility for people to imagine a time without invention because it is the invention that enhances our society in all aspects.
Invention indeed plays an essential role in our life. Had it not been for it, we could not have lived in a modern society. Invention is momentous and fundamental to people what the soul is vital and significant to us. Given this, what can we do to cultivate this precious spirit ?
The measures, to my mind, are listed as following. To begin with, the authorities concerned should set up favorable laws and regulations to encourage invention.For example, we can set up the practice of giving premiums to inventors. What is more, the public are expected to realize the significance of invention, so that they can try their best to invent things. Last but not least, the press should place more value on invention. Though there is a long way to go, I firmly believe that our combined efforts will be rewarded at last.
